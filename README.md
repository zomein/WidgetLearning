# WidgetLearning
a simple app used to learn widgets

This app currently demonstrates two core widget functionalities in a simple manner: 

    1.) Pass data from app to widget for display:
        - Run main app
        - type into textfield
        - click update button
        - return to home screen and view text passed to widget
        * if widget is not shown in iPhone home screen: 
            - click and hold on any app
            - select 'edit home screen
            - once in edit mode, click add '+' button in top left of iphone screen
            - search for widget app using search bar 
        
    2.) Allow user to edit/configure widget directly from homescreen 
        - Run widget extension (running main app works too) 
        - Go to widget; tap and hold on widget
        - select 'Edit widget'
        - use menu to configure widget
